This project is a fundamental part of the 42 curriculum, where I recreated a wide range of standard C library functions from scratch. The goal is to gain a deep understanding of C's core mechanics, low-level memory management, and fundamental algorithms without relying on any pre-existing libraries.

## âœ¨ Key Features & Challenges

This library was built under the strict standards of the 42 school, demonstrating proficiency in key areas of software development:

* **Written from Scratch:** Every function is implemented using only the most basic C features, with no external libraries allowed.
* **Norm-Compliant:** The entire codebase adheres to the `Norminette`, a strict coding standard enforced at 42. This ensures high readability, consistency, and maintainability.
* **Memory Safe:** All functions that allocate memory (`malloc`) are paired with appropriate deallocation logic, ensuring there are no memory leaks.
* **Robust & Reliable:** The project is compiled with the `-Wall -Wextra -Werror` flags, guaranteeing that the code is free from common errors and warnings. Functions are designed to handle edge cases gracefully without unexpected crashes (e.g., `segmentation fault`).

## ðŸ›  Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need a C compiler (like `gcc` or `clang`), `make`, and `ar` installed on your system. This project is designed for UNIX-like operating systems.

### Installation & Compiling

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/beratbosnak/Libft.git
    cd Libft
    ```

2.  **Compile the library using `make`:**
    The following commands are available:
    * `make` or `make all`: Compiles source files and creates the static library `libft.a`.
    * `make clean`: Removes temporary object files (`.o`).
    * `make fclean`: Removes object files and the `libft.a` library.
    * `make re`: Re-compiles the library by running `fclean` and `all` sequentially.

## ðŸš€ Usage Example

Here's a simple example of how to use the `libft` library in your own project.

1.  Create a `main.c` file in the same directory as `libft.a` and `libft.h`:

    ```c
    #include "libft.h"
    #include <unistd.h> // For the STDOUT_FILENO constant
    #include <stdlib.h> // For free

    int main(void)
    {
        char *str1 = "Building my own ";
        char *str2 = "library is fun!";
        char *joined_str;

        // Using ft_strjoin to concatenate two strings
        joined_str = ft_strjoin(str1, str2);

        // Using ft_putendl_fd to print the result
        if (joined_str)
        {
            ft_putendl_fd(joined_str, STDOUT_FILENO);
            free(joined_str); // Don't forget to free allocated memory
        }
        return (0);
    }
    ```

2.  Compile your project and link it with the `libft` library:

    ```bash
    cc main.c -L. -lft -o my_program
    ```

3.  Run your program:
    ```bash
    ./my_program
    ```
    **Expected Output:**
    ```
    Building my own library is fun!
    ```

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To ensure the robustness and correctness of all functions, especially for edge cases, the project was rigorously validated. For this purpose, I used the comprehensive `libftTester` created by [Tripouille](https://github.com/Tripouille/libftTester). My implementation successfully passes all tests.

## ðŸ“š Function Reference

This library includes the mandatory functions as required by the project. The functions are grouped by category for clarity.

**Note on Memory Management:** Functions that return a new string, substring, or an array of strings allocate the necessary memory with `malloc`. The caller is responsible for freeing this memory to prevent leaks.

| Category      | Function      | Description                                                    |
